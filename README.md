Ruby Server

Ruby server is a tiny web server written in pure ruby. I wanted to understand how webservers work under the hood, hence this project. 

Future to do:

* Add root homepage support
* Implement HEAD response (per HTTP1.1 specs)
* Error handling returning 500 status code
* Add support for POST requests
